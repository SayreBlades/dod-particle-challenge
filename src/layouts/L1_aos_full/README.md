## What this layout is

**AoS** (Array-of-Structs) is the natural OOP layout: one array of `Particle`
records, each record carrying *every* field the object would own, laid out
contiguously in memory as a single 68-byte struct per particle. Walking the
array touches one full struct after another.

**Full-field** means we kept all 11 fields — the honest strawman, the OOP
object as first written: position and velocity (the hot physics), age and life
(the death decision), color/size/rotation/mass/flags/kind/seed (everything an
object would carry). Nothing trimmed, nothing split off. The dead fields (the
ones the hot loops never read) ARE this layout's identity — they're the bytes
later layouts reclaim.

This is the **strawman** baseline: the worst-case "OOP" layout every later
layout is measured against. It wastes bytes, but it's also the simplest
possible thing — no indirection, no vtables, no allocation churn — so it's the
*best-case* OOP too. That gap (best-case OOP vs. the bandwidth floor) is the
honest ceiling for any layout win here.

## The struct

```
particles: []Particle        ONE AoS array, plain alloc, natural alignment
┌────────┬────────┬──────┬─────┬───────┬──────┬──────────┬──────┬───────┬──────┬──────┐
│pos 12B │vel 12B │life 4│age 4│color16│size 4│rotation 4│mass 4│flags 1│kind 1│seed 4│  = 68 B
└────────┴────────┴──────┴─────┴───────┴──────┴──────────┴──────┴───────┴──────┴──────┘
```

- **bytes/p:** 68 · **streams:** 1 · **field set:** full (11 fields — the OOP
  object as first written; the dead fields ARE the layout's identity)
- **allocation:** plain `alloc`, 4 B alignment, exact length

**Audit fingerprint** (N=1024, 600 steps, gzip oracle — 11 AoS-strided blobs):

| field | density |   | field    |   density |
|-------|--------:|---|----------|----------:|
| pos   |   0.734 |   | rotation |     0.012 |
| vel   |   0.743 |   | mass     |     0.013 |
| age   |   0.879 |   | size     |     0.013 |
| seed  |   0.361 |   | life     |     0.013 |
| kind  |   0.317 |   | flags    |     0.038 |
| color |   0.036 |   | **MEAN** | **0.361** |

Read: 39 B of the 68 B struct (life/color/size/rotation/mass/flags) carries
~0 bits of information per frame — the indictment that drives L2 (lean field
set). This is the reference fingerprint every later layout's audit compares
against.
